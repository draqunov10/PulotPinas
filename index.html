                Background of the Study
            </h2>
            <strong>In the labyrinth of modern industry lies a hidden menace — hazardous waste.</strong>
            <p>
                In 2022, the Philippines has totalled about 252,800 tons of generated hazardous waste [1]. With the country's increasing population along with industrial and technological advancements done for economic progress, if measures to mitigate exploitative actions from Hazardous Waste Generators (HWGs) are not made, we can only expect that the yearly hazardous waste generation to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overproduction and unmanaged hazardous wastes have serious harmful consequences in the environment and in human health [2]. Hazardous wastes demand more efforts in analysis and segregation for their safe disposal. Therefore, there are limited locations that can accomodate them. Depending on the substance and quantity, hazardous waste pose a threat to land and marine biodiversity, those of which share the space. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The health of the citizens is also potentially compromised as there is increased exposure to toxins and pollutants. Human health complications due to hazardous substance susceptibility vary from minor discomforts like headaches and nausea to more serious issues such as genetic mutation and even death.

            About Project "Pulot Pinas"
        </h2>
    
        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            Group LNT recognizes the need to understand and assess the Philippines' current situation when it comes to Hazardous Waste Production. Thus, Project "Pulot Pinas" came to be. The project is an effort for the fulfilment of 
            <b>Sustainable Development Goals #11 and #12</b> which are <b>"Sustainable Cities and Communities"</b> and <b>"Repsonsible Consumption and Production"</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            The project aims to address the following questions:
        </p>

        <div class="about-questions">
            <p class="about-question">
                Which regions have generated the most amount of hazardous waste over the years?
            </p>
    
            <p class="about-question">
                What is the most generated type of hazardous waste in NCR?

            Hypotheses
        </h3>

        <p>
            We hypothesize that HWGs have been growing at a rate proportional to both population growth and economic advancements. Consequently, we hypothesize that the number of approved HWGs per year have been growing according to waste production. 
        </p>

            Proposed Solutions
        </h3>
            
        <p>
            Through this study, the group aims to produce information about the national state of waste management, particularly on the handling of hazardous wastes. The trends of the construction of more HWGs found in this research shall also prove to be useful in considering more ethical and environment-friendly courses of action in talks of waste disposal.

            Data Collection Process
        </h2>
    
        <h3>
            Dataset Source
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            The primary source for our dataset is provided by the <i>Environmental Management Bureau</i> from the <i>Department of Environment Resources of the Republic of the Philippines</i>. The organization continously monitors the establishment of new registered HWGs as well as the maintenance of previously registered HWGs and makes the information readily available through their official webpage. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            Moreover, the history of updates made to the dataset over the span of the dates June 17, 2020 and the present date is readily available. Modifying the range results in the filtering of the whole dataset in such a way that only those whose date of approval lies between the range reflect on the current presented dataset.  Here, the No. of HWGs by Region is also provided via bar graph. Such data can also be manipulated by the date approved range feature. 
        </p>
    
        <strong>Primary Dataset: </strong>
        <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzQyMmRjZjAtYjNkMi00Y2Q0LWI0YTItNDkzMTQ3YTA1NGFhIiwidCI6ImY2ZjRhNjkyLTQzYjMtNDMzYi05MmIyLTY1YzRlNmNjZDkyMCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D">Registered Hazardous Waste Generators (HWGs)</a>
    
        <h3>
            Scope and Limitations
        </h3>
        <p>    
            As of April 17, 2024, there are over 33,000 observations from 2020 to 2024. The group interacted with the Microsoft Power BI interface of the source and set the range of date approved to be between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Furthermore, the sample population for this research is limited to the NCR region. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Therefore, the study considers only those HWGs whose operations are approved within the year 2022. Note that the working dataset does not correspond to all existing HWGs in the Philippines in the set range. Also, only HWGs within the NCR region will be included in the study. Note that findings made in this study does not necessarily reflect the trends of the whole Philippines.
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            Data Extraction and Pre-processing Plans
        </h3>
        <p>
            The group manually collected and collated the information on a Google Sheets file for ease of manipulation during exploratory analysis later on. With the stated limitations, the total observations totaled to 7,582 HWGs. 
    
            During the encoding of the data, redundancies in multiple attributes were observed. Thus, the group plans to clean the data specifically found in the “Nature of Business” and "Details" attributes. Similarly, machine learning AI is planned to be applied to analyze and further segregate the observations according to their accompanying attributes to account for differing characters. Categorization, in this manner, is based on the presence of shared words and similar themes. 
    
        </p>

        <h3>
            Description of Dataset
        </h3>
        <p>
            The dataset shows the directory of all the existing HWGs in the Philippines. Each HWG has the following attributes: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Region: pertains to the region in which the location of the HWG belongs to</li>
            <li>Nature of Business: pertains to the type of industry or trade the HWG performs</li>
            <li>Nature: pertains to the state of matter of the HWG’s waste primarily generated</li>
            <li>HW Code: pertains to the category in which the waste generated is put based on characteristics and origin </li>
            <li>Details: pertains to other pertinent information regarding the waste generated</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Considering the scope of this study, the dataset size is set to be about 7582 HWGs whose dates of approval lie within the range of January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
