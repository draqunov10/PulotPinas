                Background of the Study
            </h2>
            <p class="background-quote">In the labyrinth of modern industry lies a hidden menace — hazardous waste.</p>
            <p class="background-text">
                In 2022, the Philippines has totalled about 252,800 tons of generated hazardous waste [1]. With the country's increasing population along with industrial and technological advancements done for economic progress, if measures to mitigate exploitative actions from Hazardous Waste Generators (HWGs) are not made, we can only expect that the yearly hazardous waste generation to follow.
            </p>
            <p class="background-text">
                Overproduction and unmanaged hazardous wastes have serious harmful consequences in the environment and in human health [2]. Hazardous wastes demand more efforts in analysis and segregation for their safe disposal. Therefore, there are limited locations that can accomodate them. Depending on the substance and quantity, hazardous waste pose a threat to land and marine biodiversity, those of which share the space. 
            </p>
            <p class="background-text">
                The health of the citizens is also potentially compromised as there is increased exposure to toxins and pollutants. Human health complications due to hazardous substance susceptibility vary from minor discomforts like headaches and nausea to more serious issues such as genetic mutation and even death.

            About Project "Pulot Pinas"
        </h2>
        
        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            Group LNT recognizes the need to understand and assess the Philippines' current situation when it comes to Hazardous Waste Production. Thus, Project "Pulot Pinas" came to be. The project is an effort for the fulfilment of 
            <b>Sustainable Development Goals #11 and #12</b> which are <b>"Sustainable Cities and Communities"</b> and <b>"Repsonsible Consumption and Production"</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            The project aims to address the following questions:
        </p>
        
        <div class="about-questions">
            <p class="about-question">
                Which regions have generated the most amount of hazardous waste over the years?
            </p>
            
            <p class="about-question">
                What is the most generated type of hazardous waste in NCR?
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            For these questions, the team has the following null hypotheses:
        </p>
        
        <div class="about-questions">
            <div class="about-question">
                <p class="about-question-highlight">
                    The population of a region is not directly proportional to the amount of hazardous waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we hypothesize that Region IV (CALABARZON), Region NCR (National Capital Region) and Region 3 (Central Luzon) among others would appear under this category as the regions making up almost 40% of the country's total population [1].
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-question">
                <p class="about-question-highlight">
                    The National Capital Region does not yield mostly to Electronics-related wastes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to rapid technological advancements and the region's being the center of urbanization, we presume that the National Capital Region would have generators yielding Electronics-related wastes like outdated gadgets and equipment the most among other hazardous wastes.

                    The primary source for our dataset is provided by the <i>Environmental Management Bureau</i> from the <i>Department of Environment Resources of the Republic of the Philippines</i>. 
                    The organization continously monitors the establishment of new registered Hazardous Waste Generators as well as the maintenance of previously registered HWGs and makes the information readily available through their official webpage. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Moreover, the history of updates made to the dataset over the span of the dates June 17, 2020 and the present date is readily available. Modifying the range results in the filtering of the whole dataset in such a way that only those whose date of approval lies between the range reflect on the current presented dataset.  Here, the No. of HWGs by Region is also provided via bar graph. Such data can also be manipulated by the date approved range feature.

                    Additionally, the organization monitors the amount of hazardous waste generated on each region. 
                    The dataset provided started from the year 2012 up to the year 2022. 
                    The said dataset contains a comprehensive detail on the amount (in tons) and the type of hazardous wastes produced in the Philippines.

                <p>
                    In relation to the amount of hazardous waste generated source, the team also acquired a Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) vector maps (shapefiles) to visualize the data mentioned before. 
                    There are different levels of vector maps available, from the national level down to the barangay level. 
                    This vector map was sourced from public data and updated annually with the changes published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

                    As of April 17, 2024, there are over 33,000 observations from 2020 to 2024 on the HWGs dataset. The group interacted with the Microsoft Power BI interface of the source and set the range of date approved to be between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Furthermore, the sample population for this research is limited to the NCR region. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the study considers only those HWGs whose operations are approved within the year 2022. Note that the working dataset does not correspond to all existing HWGs in the Philippines in the set range. Also, only HWGs within the NCR region will be included in the study. Note that findings made in this study does not necessarily reflect the trends of the whole Philippines.

                <p>
                    As for the rest of the sources, the team utilized the total amount of hazardous waste generated by region and by type from 2012 to 2022 as the focus of the study is to analyze the waste on each region over the years. 
                    Unfortunately, there are no records of the hazardous waste generated in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) all throughout the years. The team will not be able to include this region in the analysis.

                    The group manually collected and collated the information on PowerBI interface to a Google Sheets file for ease of manipulation during exploratory analysis later on. 
                    With the stated limitations, the total observations totaled to 7,582 HWGs. 
                    During the encoding of the data, certain records had empty values. The team filled these in depending on Nature of Business and Details. 
                    Similarly, machine learning AI is planned to be applied to analyze and further segregate the observations according to their accompanying attributes to account for differing characters. 
                    Categorization, in this manner, is based on the presence of shared words and similar themes.

                    Since the amuont of waste dataset is in the form of a Google Sheets file, simple extraction was made by copying the total amount columns on each region, repeated for every year.
                    This creates a datasheet containing a row for each region, filled with total amount of waste generated for each year in their correspondong columns.
                    For it to be visualized, we only needed to download the regional level shapefile. 
                    Note that a vector map cannot be directly open unlike sheets. A processing libary called geopandas was applied.

                        The hazardous waste generated by each region is given by the interactive slide deck on this side. Feel free to scroll and compare the status of the Philippines over the years from 2012 up to 2022.

                    <p class="results-p">
                        As we can see, the interactive figure above visualizes the harardous waste generated on each region over the year 2012 to 2022. The results show that the region that have generated on year 2012 up to 2022 are the following in sequence: <b>Region IV-A, Region IV-A, Region X, Region III, Region III, CAR, CAR, Region IV-A, Region IV-A, Region IV-A.</b> 
                    </p>

                    <p class="results-p">
                        It's especially interesting to see Region IV, CALABARZON, has produced about 6 million tons of waste produced in the year 2013, which is marked as the highest waste production intensity. Alarmingly, CALABARZON has consistently been a part of the highest intensity regions in each respective year.

                    <p>
                        To prove the validity of the hypothesis, linear regression was used with an alpha value of 0.05. The test yielded <b>the relationship between a region's population and hazardous waste generation to be significant</b>, with a p-value of 2.832 x 10^-6. As such, the null hypothesis is rejected and the presented alternate hypothesis is true, that is, the population of a region is directly proportional to the amount of hazardous waste.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-top: 3%">
                        This implies that more people lead to more industrical, residential, or commercial activities that produce hazardous waste. 
                        Unfortunately, there is an impact as well to the environment, this relationship highlights the damage with population growth, eseentially saying that more people leads to more waste. 
                        As an effect, this concerns the public health, there is a need for more resources toward hazardous waste management, better sustainable practices, and urban planning.

                        As can be observed from the bar graph above, it is confirmed that <b>'Electronic Wastes' prevail in generation quantity in 
                        the National Capital Region</b>, amounting to about 1250 Hazardous Waste Generators. Following leading hazardous waste

                        enough to prove that Electronic Wastes are statistically the most generated type of waste in the National Capital Region.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="results-p">
                        This hypothesis was based on the report published by the Philippine Statistics Authority that states that the National Capital
                        Region is around 100% urbanized. It is therefore reasonable to expect that there is a significant amount of electrical waste 
                        produced in the National Capital Region. The researchers focused on the National Capital Region due to this fact but are yet 
                        unable to prove the conclusiveness of the hypothesis. Future studies can focus on extending their scope to other regions as well
                        to test the effect of urbanization on the type of hazardous waste generated.

                    It is evident that most of the time, the leading hazardous waste generator is the National Capital Region. Next to it is the CALABARZON (Region IV-A), this ties up with our first hypothesis, that it is the region where most of waste are produced throughout the years.

It is unexpected that NCR's trend has been decreasing over the months, so are Central Luzon, MIMAROPA, Zamboanga Peninsula, and Northern Mindanao. This may be a good sign that the region is managing its waste properly. However, the regions V, VI, VIII, and XIII are increasing in trend, which is alarming. 
                    For the rest, due to its horizontal-like trend, it shows that the regioins are maintaining their amount of hazardous waste generation.
