                Background of the Study
            </h2>
            <strong>In the labyrinth of modern industry lies a hidden menace — hazardous waste.</strong>
            <p>
                In 2022, the Philippines has totalled about 252,800 tons of generated hazardous waste [1]. With the country's increasing population along with industrial and technological advancements done for economic progress, if measures to mitigate exploitative actions from Hazardous Waste Generators (HWGs) are not made, we can only expect that the yearly hazardous waste generation to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overproduction and unmanaged hazardous wastes have serious harmful consequences in the environment and in human health [2]. Hazardous wastes demand more efforts in analysis and segregation for their safe disposal. Therefore, there are limited locations that can accomodate them. Depending on the substance and quantity, hazardous waste pose a threat to land and marine biodiversity, those of which share the space. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The health of the citizens is also potentially compromised as there is increased exposure to toxins and pollutants. Human health complications due to hazardous substance susceptibility vary from minor discomforts like headaches and nausea to more serious issues such as genetic mutation and even death.

            About Project "Pulot Pinas"
        </h2>
    
        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            Group LNT recognizes the need to understand and assess the Philippines' current situation when it comes to Hazardous Waste Production. Thus, Project "Pulot Pinas" came to be. The project is an effort for the fulfilment of 
            <b>Sustainable Development Goals #11 and #12</b> which are <b>"Sustainable Cities and Communities"</b> and <b>"Repsonsible Consumption and Production"</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            The project aims to address the following questions:
        </p>

        <div class="about-questions">
            <p class="about-question">
                Which regions have generated the most amount of hazardous waste over the years?
            </p>
    
            <p class="about-question">
                What is the most generated type of hazardous waste in NCR?
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="about-text" style="text-align: center;">
            For these questions, the team has the following hypotheses:
        </p>

        <div class="about-questions">
            <p class="about-question">
                The population of a region could be directly proportional to the amount of hazardous waste. Thus, we hypothesize that Region IV (CALABARZON), Region NCR (National Capital Region) and Region 3 (Central Luzon) among others would appear under this category as the regions making up almost 40% of the country's total population [1].
            </p>
    
            <p class="about-question">
                Due to rapid technological advancements and the region's being the center of urbanization, we presume that the National Capital Region would have generators yielding Electronics-related wastes like outdated gadgets and equipment the most among other hazardous wastes.

                    The primary source for our dataset is provided by the <i>Environmental Management Bureau</i> from the <i>Department of Environment Resources of the Republic of the Philippines</i>. 
                    The organization continously monitors the establishment of new registered Hazardous Waste Generators as well as the maintenance of previously registered HWGs and makes the information readily available through their official webpage. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Moreover, the history of updates made to the dataset over the span of the dates June 17, 2020 and the present date is readily available. Modifying the range results in the filtering of the whole dataset in such a way that only those whose date of approval lies between the range reflect on the current presented dataset.  Here, the No. of HWGs by Region is also provided via bar graph. Such data can also be manipulated by the date approved range feature.

                    Additionally, the organization monitors the amount of hazardous waste generated on each region. 
                    The dataset provided started from the year 2012 up to the year 2022. 
                    The said dataset contains a comprehensive detail on the amount (in tons) and the type of hazardous wastes produced in the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In relation to the amount of hazardous waste generated source, the team also acquired a Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) vector maps (shapefiles) to visualize the data mentioned before. 
                    There are different levels of vector maps available, from the national level down to the barangay level. 
                    This vector map was sourced from public data and updated annually with the changes published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

                <p>    
                    As of April 17, 2024, there are over 33,000 observations from 2020 to 2024 on the HWGs dataset. The group interacted with the Microsoft Power BI interface of the source and set the range of date approved to be between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Furthermore, the sample population for this research is limited to the NCR region. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the study considers only those HWGs whose operations are approved within the year 2022. Note that the working dataset does not correspond to all existing HWGs in the Philippines in the set range. Also, only HWGs within the NCR region will be included in the study. Note that findings made in this study does not necessarily reflect the trends of the whole Philippines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for the rest of the sources, the team utilized the total amount of hazardous waste generated by region and by type from 2012 to 2022 as the focus of the study is to analyze the waste on each region over the years. 
                    Unfortunately, there are no records of the hazardous waste generated in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) all throughout the years. The team will not be able to include this region in the analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, The data of the geometry (vector map) of the Philippines on Regional level was used to visualize the data on the map.

                    The group manually collected and collated the information on PowerBI interface to a Google Sheets file for ease of manipulation during exploratory analysis later on. 
                    With the stated limitations, the total observations totaled to 7,582 HWGs. 
                    During the encoding of the data, certain records had empty values. The team filled these in depending on Nature of Business and Details. 
                    Similarly, machine learning AI is planned to be applied to analyze and further segregate the observations according to their accompanying attributes to account for differing characters. 
                    Categorization, in this manner, is based on the presence of shared words and similar themes.

                    Since the amuont of waste dataset is in the form of a Google Sheets file, simple extraction was made by copying the total amount columns on each region, repeated for every year.
                    This creates a datasheet containing a row for each region, filled with total amount of waste generated for each year in their correspondong columns.
                    For it to be visualized, we only needed to download the regional level shapefile. 
                    Note that a vector map cannot be directly open unlike sheets. A processing libary called geopandas was applied.

                        As we can see, the interactive figure above visualizes the harardous waste generated on each region over the year 2012 to 2022. The results show that the region that have generated on year 2012 up to 2022 are the following in sequence: <b>Region IV-A, Region IV-A, Region X, Region III, Region III, CAR, CAR, Region IV-A, Region IV-A, Region IV-A.</b>

                        It's especially interesting to see Region IV, CALABARZON, has produced about 6 million tons of waste produced in the year 2013, which is marked as the highest waste production intensity. Alarmingly, CALABARZON has consistently been a part of the highest intensity regions in each respective year.

                        To prove the validity of the hypothesis, linear regression was used with an alpha value of 0.05. The test yielded <b>the relationship between a region's population and hazardous waste generation to be significant</b>, with a p-value of 2.832 x 10^-6. As such, the null hypothesis is rejected and the presented alternate hypothesis is true.
